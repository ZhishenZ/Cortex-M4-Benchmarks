# Cortex-M4-Thesis-Benchmarks

This repo contains the benchmarks from thesis “Boosting Cortex-M Microcontroller Time and Energy Efficiency for Memory-intensive Applications”

The directories with name ending "ccm" are the benchmarks, in which both instructions and data are located in the CCM-SRAM.

For the other cases the allocation of instructions and data are modified by the macro. 

The code for benchmarks are in the directory `Cortex-M4-Thesis-Benchmarks/benchmark_name/Core/Src`
